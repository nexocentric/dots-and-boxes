Dots and Boxes
==============

This project was made as a small personal project to create the [Dots and Boxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes) game using JavaScript. This program works in a modern web browser.

Installation
------------

Please downloaded the latest zip from this repository and open the [app.html](./app.html) file in your web browser.

Game Play
---------

The interface for the game is fairly crude, but the game is simple to play. The web browser will notifiy you of whose turn it is. Click one of the yellow lines to make a move and then follow the instructions on the screen.

Enjoy!
